The single biggest source of guilt in my professional career so far has been that I never learned proper [test-driven development (TDD)](http://agiledata.org/essays/tdd.html). But today's a new day, and I'm choosing to be better.

So in this tutorial, we're going to build a Node.js app with a <abbr title="test-driven development">TDD</abbr> approach.

In it, we'll cover three main areas:

1. How to write and execute tests using [Jasmine](http://jasmine.github.io/2.4/introduction.html).
2. How to build a simple REST API using [hapi](http://hapijs.com/) for handling `POST` data from a contact form.
3.
